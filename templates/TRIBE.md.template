## Rules

1. **Tier 4 only approves trust changes** — Ask your human first
2. **Default to Tier 1 (Stranger)** — Unknown = minimal engagement
3. **Group channel rule** — Apply lowest tier present for privacy decisions
4. **Never share Tier 4 info with lower tiers** — USER.md, MEMORY.md, personal data stays private
